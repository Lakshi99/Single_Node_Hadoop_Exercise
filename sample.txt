Docker is an open-source platform that revolutionizes the way developers build, deploy, and run applications by utilizing lightweight, isolated environments known as containers. Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent behaviour across different systems and eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem. Unlike traditional virtual machines, containers share the host system's operating system kernel, making them significantly more resource-efficient and enabling rapid startup times. This efficiency reduces overhead and enhances performance, especially in large-scale environments. A core advantage of Docker lies in its ability to create standardized development environments, ensuring seamless workflows from development to testing and production. By simplifying application deployment, Docker minimizes compatibility issues and boosts collaboration among teams.
